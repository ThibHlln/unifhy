The Python package `cm4twc` (Community Model for the Terrestrial Water
Cycle) is a hydrological modelling framework which combines interchangeable
modelling components for the surface layer, subsurface, and open water
parts of the terrestrial water cycle. It is designed to foster collaborations
between land surface and hydrological modelling communities.
